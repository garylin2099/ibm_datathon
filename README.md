# Berkeley DSS IBM Datathon

  This is a data analysis project completed in a short time span of one day and a half at the Data Science Society @ Berkeley
  Datathon for Social Good.
  
Using publicly available data, the team was able to formulate a data analysis project concerning predicting safety ratings
in the Bay Area, which has potential in advising homeowners in the Bay Area to make more informed decisions.
